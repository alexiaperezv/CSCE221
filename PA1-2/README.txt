Aside from a few discussions with Peer Teachers, the only other outside resource I used was: 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
I used this resource to read documentation about the use of the move constructor and some other small
details such as definitons for the different types of sorting algorithms, etc.

I also worked on this project with my friend, Grace Li, who is also in this class.

No issues found with the code submitted.

The program: 

For this part I got rid of collection.cpp and modified previous files to meet the specifications in the instructions. 

I created new text files containing jeans (with colors and sizes) and tested the newly created templated collection class with both stress balls and jeans. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The program was tested using the Cygwin terminal and a make file that I created based on the makefile that Professor Leyk provided for the first part of the assignment. Once it was completed and tested, I used the Putty terminal to make sure that it would work on the TAs computer.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I ran the program a total of 10 times once I completed it, to ensure that all functions worked properly, and that the program outputted the right information each time. All tests passed.
